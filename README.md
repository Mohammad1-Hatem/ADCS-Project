#ADCS-Project
This project demonstrates a simple satellite ADCS based on the conservation of angular momentum. A reaction wheel is used to control the satellite’s attitude, where changing the wheel speed causes the satellite body to rotate in the opposite direction.

The system combines embedded control code for sensors, motors, and communication with MATLAB scripts for telemetry monitoring and real-time plotting, allowing end-to-end testing of the control concept.
